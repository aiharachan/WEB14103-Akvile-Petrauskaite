## Method

Prep:15min › Cook:15min › Ready in:30min

Dry-fry the mince in a frying pan until brown and crumbly, stirring occasionally and breaking it up with a wooden spoon.
Add the onion, green pepper and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened. Stir in the herbs and spices; season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the tomato puree and mix well. Cover and cook gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Place a little of the mixture on each tortilla and roll up, or spoon into the taco shells. Secure tortillas with a cocktail stick. If using tortillas, heat the oil in a frying pan and then fry the rolls quickly until golden. Serve with your choice of accompaniments.
